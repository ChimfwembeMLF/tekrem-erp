# Cards

## What is a Card?
A **Card** represents a single work item, such as a user story, task, bug, or feature. Cards are the atomic unit of work in the project management system and can be moved across boards, sprints, and epics.

## Use Cases
- Track individual tasks, stories, or bugs
- Assign work to team members
- Estimate and track story points
- Attach files, comments, and checklists

## User Actions
- Create, edit, and delete cards
- Assign cards to users, sprints, epics, or releases
- Move cards between columns, boards, sprints, and backlog
- Add comments, attachments, and checklists
- Set priority, due date, and status

## How Cards Work Together
- Cards are the building blocks of all project work
- Cards can be grouped under epics, sprints, and releases
- Progress on cards drives progress on higher-level features (epics, releases)
