# Backlog

## What is the Backlog?
The **Backlog** is a prioritized list of all work items (cards, stories, tasks, bugs) that need to be completed in a project. It serves as the single source of truth for upcoming work.

## Use Cases
- Collect and prioritize all project work
- Plan sprints by pulling from the backlog
- Refine and estimate work before scheduling

## User Actions
- Add, edit, and delete backlog items (cards)
- Prioritize and reorder items
- Assign items to sprints, epics, or releases
- Move items between backlog and sprints
- Filter and search backlog by status, assignee, or type

## How the Backlog Works Together
- The backlog feeds work into sprints and releases
- Items are refined and estimated before being scheduled
- Backlog management ensures the team is always working on the most valuable tasks
