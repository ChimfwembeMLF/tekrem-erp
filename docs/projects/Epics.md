# Epics

## What is an Epic?
An **Epic** is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (user stories, cards, or issues). Epics represent high-level goals or features that span multiple sprints or releases.

## Use Cases
- Organize related work under a common theme or goal
- Track progress of large features
- Group cards/tasks for reporting and planning

## User Actions
- Create, edit, and delete epics
- Assign color, description, and status
- Link cards (stories/tasks/bugs) to an epic
- Link epics to releases
- View epic progress (story points, percent complete, card status)
- View all cards and releases associated with an epic

## How Epics Work Together
- Epics group related cards and can span multiple sprints
- Progress on an epic is tracked by the completion of its cards
- Epics can be included in releases for version planning
- Epics help teams focus on delivering larger features incrementally
