# Sprints

## What is a Sprint?
A **Sprint** is a fixed-length iteration (usually 1-4 weeks) during which a team works to complete a set of tasks or cards. Sprints are the core unit of work in agile project management.

## Use Cases
- Plan and execute work in short, focused cycles
- Track team velocity and capacity
- Review and improve team performance after each sprint

## User Actions
- Create, edit, and delete sprints
- Set sprint name, goal, start/end dates, and team capacity
- Assign cards to a sprint
- Start, complete, or archive a sprint
- View sprint progress (story points, cards completed, burndown chart)
- Move incomplete cards to backlog or next sprint

## How Sprints Work Together
- Sprints help teams deliver value incrementally
- Cards are planned into sprints from the backlog
- Sprint completion and velocity inform future planning
- Sprints can be linked to releases for version delivery
