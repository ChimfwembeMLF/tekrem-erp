## Cookie Consent Banner Requirements

- A UI component (banner) that appears at the bottom/top of the page, explaining cookie usage and offering “Accept” (and optionally “Decline”) buttons.
- Logic to store the user’s consent (usually in localStorage or cookies).
- Logic to hide the banner after consent is given.
- (Optional) Styling to match your Tailwind theme.
- (Optional) A link to your privacy policy.
- You do NOT need to change your tailwind.config.js unless you want to customize the banner’s colors or fonts.

### What else is needed?

- If you use cookies for analytics, tracking, or personalization, update your privacy policy.
- If you’re in the EU or similar regions, ensure compliance with GDPR or local laws.
- If you use third-party scripts (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.), only load them after consent if required by law.
