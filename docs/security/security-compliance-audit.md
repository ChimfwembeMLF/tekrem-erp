    'model_type' => MomoTransaction::class,
    'model_id' => $transaction->id,
    'old_values' => null,

// Implement generic error responses
public function handleApiException($exception)
{
    if (app()->environment('production')) {
        return response()->json([
            'success' => false,
            'message' => 'An error occurred processing your request',
            'error_code' => $this->getGenericErrorCode($exception)
        ], 500);
    }
    
    // Detailed errors only in development
    return response()->json([
        'success' => false,
        'message' => $exception->getMessage(),
        'trace' => $exception->getTraceAsString()
    ], 500);
}
```
